# socialsecurity-benefits
The Social Security Benefits spreadsheet helps one determine the optimal year in which to claim Social Security benefits given one's own earnings history (and projections) and a particular longevity. Of course, longevity is impossible to know for sure, but the idea is that one can at least use the tool to learn the tradeoffs between filing early and delaying.

This spreadsheet is primarily intended as an educational tool to learn the formulas and calculations used to determine one's benefits. It is *NOT* comprehensive and should not be considered an alternative to a consultation with a Social Security representative.
